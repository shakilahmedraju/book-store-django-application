# Display Book
At homepage I displayed books from the database with category and author filter option

# Add Book
For adding book to database I kept name, price, stock, description, select writer option, select category option and upload a front page of the book. After adding a book to the database, it redirects to you on the book display page.

# Add Book
1. When a user clicks on add to cart, the book information will store on the session and redirect to cart page. 

2. If the user wants to continue shopping then he can visit the book display page by clicking on the Continue Shopping button on the cart page and can add another cart item to the session. 

3. User can delete cart item from the cart page
